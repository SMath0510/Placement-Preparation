# The Overall Placement Experience

To all the people here preparing for placements, just a heads-up before we discuss what needs to be done and what you need to prepare for:

The **only thing you can control in this process is your effort**. The overall process is heavily **luck-dependent** (or "high variance," as some math enthusiasts say).  
All the bestâ€”and give it your best!

## Setting Your Target Role

The **first thing to decide before starting your preparation is your target role!**  
Trust me, it is very important to fix your goal before starting the preparation. This is the one thing I regret not doing. Initially, I was confused about choosing between a software developer role or a quantitative trader/researcher role.

### Trader/Researcher  
**Key Skills:**  
- Data Interpretation  
- Analytical Thinking  
- Algorithmic Thinking  
- Quick Adaptation  

### Software Developer  
**Key Skills:**  
- Algorithmic Thinking  
- Knowledge of CS concepts (Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, etc.)
- Familiarity with Relevant Software Tools and Languages (C++, SQL, Python, etc.)

---

### Why Is This Important?

Deciding on your goal is critical because there is **almost zero overlap** between the preparation paths for these two roles.  

I spent three months being unsure and confused. Finally, one month before the final interviews, I decided to go with the **Quantitative Trading/Research** role because I realized I was more inclined towards finance and markets than the usage and development of software tools.

> **Niranjan:** I was preparing for 3 different roles for a while (quant, core elec, software), thinking that I would maximize my chances if I cast as wide a net as possbile. Later I realized it wasn't really feasible to do this. "A jack of all trades is a master of none." I decided to stick with **Software Engineering** because I enjoyed the SWE work I did in various insti clubs and projects.

# Placement Preparation Guide

While preparing for any of these topics, remember that none of the questions you prepare for will appear as they are in tests or interviews. The purpose of preparation is to familiarize yourself with the concepts and their applications.

(He has 2 major books, which give advice on writing high-quality C++ using features specific to it. It tells you how other people use C++ features to write maintainable code)

Learn as much as you can, but make sure that you definitely cover the following: (abridged from [this very nice list](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/19a947f/comment/kijytx9/) -- read if you get the time)
- STL containers -- `vector`, `array` (different from `x[]` arrays), (`unordered_`)`set`, (`unordered_`)`map`, `flat_map`, `string`, `list`, `queue`, `stack`, `deque` -- know basics of how these things are implemented, and which one is fastest for which applications
- Heap vs. stack allocation -- when to use what, which containers use which, `new`/`delete`
- Inheritance -- `virtual` functions, `virtual` inheritance, abstract classes, type erasure, virtual function tables (why is it slow), "rule of 5" (virtual destructor)
- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `bit_cast`, why are these better than normal casting?
- Pass by value, reference, and const-reference; dangling reference
- Smart pointers, and pointer types (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`, `string_view`)
- Compiler vs. linker vs. assembler, what is `static`, why are `.cpp` files different from `.h` files
- Function/operator overloading, argument-dependent lookup
- Templates, template inference, SFINAE
- `std::move` semantics, why/how would you use `std::forward` (`&` vs `&&`), copy ellision
- Function objects vs. function pointers, lambdas, `auto` keyword in lambdas, closures
- Compile-time polymorphism (`std::variant`, CRTP)
- Compile-time evaluation (`const` vs `constexpr`, `consteval`, passing objects as template parameters)

### Operating Systems (OS)

- **Linux and Its Working** (Book)
(Main focus of this book could be to get familiarized with different linux commands and implementation of various linux based methods (file directory management, user permissions, kernel implementation, etc.))

Learn as much as you can, but make sure that you definitely cover the following:
- Virtual memory vs physical memory, paging, why it exists
- Semaphores, locks and various locked data structures, and examples of race conditions
- INodes and how file systems work
- Calculations based on virtual memory (e.g. how many pages can this multi-level page table address?)
- Calculations based on `fork()` and number of handles being created

### Computer Architecture
- [**IITB Playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw6vmiIQrilTWa5twNV8opVJ3ge_kEfsM)
(This is a concise playlist for revising complete comp arch.)

Learn as much as you can, but make sure that you definitely cover the following:
- Caches, levels of caches, how are each of these used?
- Cache synchronization, why is it hard? When can writing parallelized code be slower?
- TLB
- Pipelining, what causes pipeline stall, when would you want to intentionally stall?
- Superscalar processors and out-of-order execution, memory barriers and `std::atomic` in C++

# Interview Experiences

## 1. TrexQuant  
I visited the TrexQuant office, and the evaluation process was as follows:  
- **11:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** Introduction to Trading Alphas  
- **12:00 PM - 3:00 PM:** Given a Jupyter Notebook, develop a modification technique to improve the current alpha (e.g., using mathematical operators for smoothing, specific trading strategies, etc.)  
- **3:00 PM - 6:00 PM:** Interview (Each individual had a 30-minute interview based on their resume and submitted alpha; there were 12-13 participants in total).  

**Key Focus Areas:**  
The firm focuses on the use of ML and DL for creating alphas and trading strategies. Having a strong background in mathematics and machine learning is a significant advantage.

---

## 2. SquarePoint  
There were three rounds of interviews conducted by SquarePoint:  
1. **Rounds 1 and 2:** Focused on probability puzzles and problems related to random walks, the central limit theorem, and Markov chains.  
2. **Round 3:** A final HR round where the interviewer asked about the resume and provided an overview of the firm's work.  

---

## 3. QuantBox  
The test for QuantBox was quite advanced, with questions resembling:  
- **102 Problems in Combinatorics**  
- **3Blue1Brown Videos**  
- **Arthur Engel** and other advanced books.  

**Interview Round:**  
- The interview questions were mathematically challenging and focused on algorithmic thinking and problem-solving (puzzles and games) rather than purely probability-based questions.

---

## 4. QuadEye  
QuadEye's evaluation consisted of **five rounds of interviews**:  
1. **Rounds 1-4:**  
   - Purely technical  
   - Each round lasted 45 minutes to 1 hour.  
   - Questions covered diverse domains:  
     - Probability puzzles  
     - Algorithmic puzzles  
     - Dice games  
     - Markov chains  
     - Statistics  
     - Finance and option pricing (especially due to my background in option pricing).  

2. **Round 5 (Final Round):**  
   - An HR round where the Head of HR explained the work involved and logistics related to the role.
